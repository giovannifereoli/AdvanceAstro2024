## ASEN6060: Advanced Astrodynamics

This course analyzed multi-body gravitational environments using the circular restricted three-body problem. This dynamical model's complex solution space is explored using numerical computation, 
characterization, and analysis of fundamental dynamical structures, as well as dynamical systems theory. These solutions create a transfer that can then be used with higher-fidelity software.
